# About This Project

This project is a very simple demo project and a possible solution for exercise 2 in chapter 3 of the book.

# How To Use

In order to run this demo these steps must be executed:

- Run `npm install` (requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) to be installed)
- Run `npm start` to start the development server to preview the React app in the browser
- Visit `localhost:3000` in the browser, if that address didn't open up anyways

# About This Solution

This solution outputs some goals I have for this book. For this, multiple components were created and then combined inside the `App` component that can be found in the `App.js` folder.

Extra components (i.e. besides the "root component" `App`) are stored in the `src/components/` folder.

If you create a project via `npx create-react-app`, you might have more files in your project folder, specificially inside the `src/` folder. You could keep those files, I just narrowed down the files to the actual relevant files (+ some basic styling) for this solution.
